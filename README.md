# FoodCachingFitting

The code in this repository defines some methods to fit models of food caching behaviour (like the ones in [FoodCachingModels](https://github.com/jbrea/FoodCachingModels.jl) to experimental data (like the one in [FoodCachingExperiments](https://github.com/jbrea/FoodCachingExperiments.jl). This repository is a submodule of [FoodCaching](https://github.com/jbrea/FoodCaching).

See [scripts](scripts) for examples.
