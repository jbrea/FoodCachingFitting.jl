# FoodCachingFitting

The code in this repository defines some methods to fit models of food caching behaviour (like the ones in [FoodCachingModels](../FoodCachingModels)) to experimental data (like the one in [FoodCachingExperiments](../FoodCachingExperiments)). This repository is a submodule of [FoodCaching](../FoodCaching).

See [scripts](scripts) for examples.
